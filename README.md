# Applications of Attosecond pulses ELI lab practice 
 The goal of the practice is to give an overview on the basic technologies involved in generation and applications of attosecond pulses. Moreover, the practice aims to get knowledge and practical training on research equipment that are used to characterize spectral, temporal and spatial properties of extreme-ultraviolet (XUV) radiation that is produced using high harmonic generation (HHG) in gases.

Python file generates the images needed to:

*Estimate the peak intensity in the laser focus of the HR GHHG Gas beamline

*Estimate the microscopic cut-off based on the intensities obtained in the previous task (Task 11) and the gas used for generation

*Calibrate the XUV FFS images

*Based on the calibrated XUV spectrum without filter obtained in the previous task, give the macroscopically obtained cut-off.

*Sum the XUV spectrum recorded without filter along the spectral axis

*Estimate the beam divergence of the XUV beam originating from the gas cell

*Estimate the divergence of the IR beam 

To run the code, it is necessary to specify the direction of the images 'Task11_holey_mirror.png', 'Task13_nofilter.png','Task13_Mgfilter.png', 'Task13_Tefilter.png' and all the .txt

The PDF file is a lab report to show the results and analysis of the data
